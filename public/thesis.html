        <h2>About this thesis</h2>
        <p>This thesis focuses on reducing the reality gap in vehicle simulation platforms by integrating a comprehensive study of road slopes. Simulation platforms are critical tools for developing and testing driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles, offering a safe, cost-effective alternative to real-world tests. However, achieving high levels of realism, especially in road and vehicle dynamics, remains a significant challenge.</p>
        <p>By incorporating detailed road slope data, this work aims to bridge the gap between simulated and real-world driving conditions. The enhanced realism enables more accurate testing of ADAS and autonomous driving technologies. This thesis delves into how custom soft-body physics engines and adaptable road models contribute to more reliable and immersive simulations, making it ideal for both academic and industry applications.</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>As the complexity of modern driver training systems, ADAS, and autonomous driving technologies continues to grow, the demand for hyper-realistic simulation platforms becomes more pronounced. These platforms are indispensable for safely testing complex driving scenarios without exposing vehicles or drivers to real-world risks. However, one of the significant hurdles is accurately modeling real-world conditions such as road geometry, traffic patterns, and environmental factors like slopes.</p>
        <p>This research leverages platforms like BeamNG.tech and Hexagonâ€™s Virtual Test Drive (VTD) to improve the accuracy of road simulations. A major innovation of this thesis is the integration of OpenStreetMap (OSM) road data with a specific focus on road slopes, a critical factor in vehicle dynamics. This addition allows for a more realistic replication of how vehicles interact with varying terrain, which is essential for ADAS testing and the development of autonomous agents.</p>
        <p>By focusing on the customization of simulation inputs, this research enhances the ability of simulation platforms to more closely mirror real-world driving environments. The study compares the performance of standard road data imports against customized imports, ultimately demonstrating how improved realism can lead to better development and testing outcomes.</p>

        <p>Here are some suggestions for improving some pages.</p>
        <section>
            <p>Collections and user profile:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Adding filters: using filters on the collections page to make it easier for users to quickly find models they're interested in when collections have many models, such as on the all models page on Printable.com.</li>
                <li>Increased medals display: modify the user profile to allow up to six medals to be displayed instead of three, allowing users to showcase a wider range of their achievements.</li>
                <li>Displaying the number of models and makes: next to the number of likes and downloads of the models, also include the total number of models uploaded and how many models have been printed (make).</li>
            </ul>

        <section>
            <p>About the user - medals section:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Redesign of the medals section: to allow users to download the medal for past levels and see who achieved each level, giving users additional motivation to achieve higher goals</li>

        <section>
            <p>Model:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Adding monthly likes and downloads progress for Prusameters: on the model page integrate the section showing the monthly progress of likes and downloads towards the PrusaMeters milestone, in order to provide users with detailed information on the performance of their model over time.</li>
                <li>Redesign of the print statistics section: to allow viewing of multiple files and support different printers, giving users a more complete overview of model printing times on different printer configurations.</li>

        <p>By implementing these proposals, the overall experience of users on the platform could be improved, making it easier for them to navigate, share and track their activities and successes.</p>
